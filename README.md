**Abstract** 

In the last two decades, the New York Police Department has been under scrutiny for racial profiling under an aggressive stop, question and frisk policy. In 2013, a federal court decision declared the policy unconstitutional and ordered reforms to reduce racial profiling. Using logistic regression and survival analysis, we ask whether racial discrimination persists in the six years after the federal courtâ€™s ruling using the NYPD stop, question and frisk dataset. We found that while stops decreased drastically, the racial compositions of people stopped were largely unchanged. Therefore, racial profiling patterns persisted even after the 2013 reforms and more action is needed to ensure the proper protection of minority peoples in New York City.
